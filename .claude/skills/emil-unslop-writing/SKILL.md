# Unslop Writing

Nobody spots AI writing from a single mistake. They spot it from an accumulation of statistical habits: the same fifty words, the same sentence shapes, the same punctuation crutches, over and over. Each one alone is defensible. Together they read as a watermark.

This skill is a pass over any prose, in two halves. First strip the tells. Then put a voice back in — this half is not optional, because text that's merely clean of tells is sterile, and sterile is its own tell.

## The pass

1. Read the text once for what it's actually trying to say. You can't rewrite a sentence you haven't understood; you'll preserve the slop's shape.
2. Sweep in order: words, then sentences, then punctuation and formatting, then claims. Each layer hides behind the one above it — a puffed-up claim is hard to see until the vocabulary around it is plain.
3. Put a voice back in (see "Sounding like someone").
4. Final read: "Which sentence here would make a reader suspect a model wrote this?" Fix it. Repeat until the answer is none.

## Words

### Trade the model vocabulary for the plain word

These words are wildly overrepresented in model output, and readers have learned to pattern-match on them. It doesn't matter that they're real words a human could use — statistically, they aren't.

| Slop | Write instead |
| --- | --- |
| delve into | dig into, look at |
| crucial, pivotal | important, or name the consequence |
| leverage, utilize | use |
| facilitate | help |
| foster, cultivate | build, grow |
| enhance | improve, or the specific change |
| showcase | show |
| underscore | show, stress |
| landscape, tapestry (abstract) | field, mix — or delete the sentence |
| garner | get, earn |
| additionally | also, and |
| numerous | many |
| in the event that | if |

Same rule for metaphor jargon that dresses a plain idea in a technical coat: *substrate* (base), *wedge* (way in), *vector* (way, method), *north star* (goal), *flywheel* (the actual feedback loop, described), *primitive* as a noun, *harness* and *scaffolding* as metaphors, *paradigm*, *nexus*. If the concrete word exists, the abstract one is costing you credibility, not adding depth.

### Say "is" and "has"

"Serves as", "stands as", "boasts", "features", "offers" are all fancy costumes for "is" and "has". "The library boasts full TypeScript support" → "The library has full TypeScript support". The costume adds syllables and a brochure smell, nothing else.

### Delete filler on sight

"In order to" → "to". "Due to the fact that" → "because". "It is important to note that" → delete the whole phrase; if it were important, the sentence after it would show that on its own.

### Cut adverbs, or fix the verb they're propping up

"Runs quickly" → "is fast", or better, the number. "Significantly improves" → the measured delta. An adverb leaning on a weak verb means the verb is wrong; a claim leaning on an intensifier means the claim has no evidence attached.

### Promotional adjectives get neutral replacements

"Vibrant", "stunning", "breathtaking", "groundbreaking", "renowned", "seamless", "robust", "nestled". These are travel-brochure words. Describe the thing; let the reader supply the adjective.

## Sentences

### "Not just X, but Y" — state Y

The construction exists to make Y sound bigger by paying an X-shaped toll first. "It's not just a linter, it's a way of thinking about code" → say what it actually does. If Y can't stand without the runway, Y is the problem.

### Break the rule of three

Models group ideas into threes compulsively — "fast, reliable, and secure" — because three sounds complete regardless of whether there are three things. Count the real items. If there are two, write two. If there are five, write five or pick the two that matter.

### Kill false ranges

"From startups to enterprises", "from simple scripts to complex applications" — "from X to Y" implies a scale with X and Y as endpoints. If there's no actual scale, it's decoration. List the things, or name the one that matters.

### Repeat the word

Cycling synonyms — *the component*, *the element*, *the widget*, *the control*, all meaning one thing — is a school-essay habit models inherited. Repetition of the right word is not a flaw; it's how the reader tracks what you're talking about. Pick the word and keep it.

### One idea per sentence

If the reader has to backtrack to parse a sentence, split it or drop a clause. Dense subordinate-clause pileups read as generated because generation optimizes for local fluency, not for a reader holding a thread.

### Name the actor

"Queries are validated" → "the compiler validates queries". Passive voice hides who does what, and models default to it because it's always grammatically safe. Passive earns its place only when the actor is unknown or genuinely irrelevant.

### Hedge once, at most

"Could potentially possibly be argued that it might" → "may". One hedge is honesty. Stacked hedges are a model avoiding commitment, and the reader feels the evasion even if they can't name it.

## Punctuation and formatting

### No em dashes

Use periods or commas. Not parentheses, not en dashes, not spaced hyphens — swapping the em dash for a different interrupter keeps the exact rhythm that reads as generated. If a thought needs separation, end the sentence.

### Colons introduce lists and examples, nothing else

The mid-sentence colon as a connector — "If you're coming from X: here's the mapping" — is a crutch for a comparison the sentence didn't need. Rewrite so the point stands alone.

### Bold is for scanning, not emphasis inflation

Don't bold every proper noun, acronym, or phrase you're proud of. And watch for the inline-header list, the strongest formatting tell there is: a bold label plus colon that restates its own line ("**Performance:** performance improved…"). Convert those to prose. A bold lead-in that ends in a period, names the item, and is followed by genuinely new information is fine — that's structure, not slop.

### Sentence case headings

"Getting started with the API", not "Getting Started With The API". Title case in headings is a default models absorbed from marketing pages.

### No decorative emojis

Not in headings, not as bullet markers. An emoji that carries meaning in chat carries a watermark in prose.

### Straight quotes in source prose

Markdown, commit messages, code comments, and docs source get straight quotes — curly quotes appearing in raw text are a generation artifact. Rendered UI copy is the opposite territory: there, real typographic characters are correct (see the ui-polish skill). The tell is curly quotes where no human would have typed them.

## Claims

### Puffery gets replaced by what happened

"A pivotal moment", "a testament to", "setting the stage for", "left an indelible mark" — these assert importance instead of demonstrating it. Cut the frame, state the event, and let the reader judge the size.

### Name the source or cut the claim

"Experts believe", "industry reports suggest", "some critics argue" — an attribution that can't be checked is a claim wearing a costume. Name the person or report, or delete it. Same for name-drop lists ("featured in TechCrunch, Wired, and The Verge") with no quote attached: pick one and say what it said.

### Delete the trailing "-ing" clause

"…, highlighting the importance of testing", "…, ensuring reliability", "…, showcasing the team's commitment". These clauses bolt an unsupported conclusion onto a fact. If the point matters, give it its own sentence with its own evidence. Usually it doesn't; delete it.

### No generic conclusions

"The future looks bright." "Only time will tell." "Exciting times ahead." A conclusion that fits any article fits none. End with a specific plan, a fact, or just end.

### Remove chatbot residue

"I hope this helps!", "Let me know if you have questions!", "Great question!", "Certainly!" — these are conversation artifacts leaking into documents. In prose they address a reader who never spoke.

### Say what it does, not how it feels

"SQL you can read", "types that follow your schema", "the database stays close at hand" describe a feeling. Replace with the mechanism or the number: "`.toSQL()` returns the exact string sent to the database", "a column rename fails the build". Two tests, applied to every sentence of this kind: can you restate it as a concrete instruction, fact, or number? And could it appear unchanged in another project's docs? Fail either, cut it.

## Sounding like someone

Stripping tells produces clean, dead text. Voiceless-but-correct is exactly what a model on its best behavior produces, so this half is what actually separates the writing from slop.

- **Have a reaction.** Facts invite opinions; give one. "Impressive, and a little unsettling" is human in a way "impressive" alone never is — real reactions are mixed.
- **Vary the rhythm.** Short sentences. Then a longer one that takes its time getting where it's going. Uniform sentence length is one of the most machine-readable features of generated text.
- **Use "I" when it fits.** First person is not unprofessional; it's evidence a person was here.
- **Be specific over evocative.** Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents churning away at 3am". The specific image can't be produced by averaging over training data — that's why it works.
- **Let a little mess in.** A tangent, an aside, an admission of uncertainty. Perfect structure looks machine-made because perfection under no time pressure is what machines produce.

## Final audit

Read the result once more and ask the one question: "What here would make a reader think a model wrote this?" You're checking for survivors — a leftover "leverage", a rule-of-three that snuck back in, a paragraph with no opinion in it. Fix, and re-read until the question comes up empty.
