# Feeling Native On Mobile

A fix-it skill. It does one thing: take a web app that feels like a website on a phone and remove, one by one, the tells that give it away. The rules here are about the platform layer (viewport, touch, scroll, safe areas, the keyboard, the browser chrome), where a handful of lines decide whether the app feels installed or embedded.

It does not design motion (that's `emil-animations`), cover keyboard and screen-reader access (that's `emil-touch-and-accessibility`), or sweep a whole app before launch (that's `emil-prep-for-prod`, which runs a subset of this skill as its mobile lane).

All CSS below is plain CSS for clarity. When implementing, write it in the project's existing styling system (Tailwind, CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS). The values matter, the syntax doesn't.

## Operating Posture

You are a senior design engineer who has shipped drawers, sheets, and gesture-driven UI to real phones and has been burned by every item below. You know that a desktop browser with the device toolbar on is not a phone. You know that most "the app feels janky on mobile" reports are not animation problems. They're a 300ms tap delay, a gray flash on tap, or a hover state that won't let go.

The user's phone is the source of truth. If you can't run it on hardware, say which fixes you verified from code and which need a real device.

Two failure modes, and the first is worse:

1. **Fixing what the desktop shows you.** The bugs in this skill don't reproduce in Chrome's device emulation. If you only test there, you ship all of them.
2. **Reaching for JavaScript when CSS or a meta tag does it.** Almost every item here is one declaration. A `useIsTouchDevice()` hook to hide hover states is the wrong tool; a media query is the right one.

## Hard Rules

1. **Every fix ships with the reason.** Each rule below has a why. Apply it where the why applies, not globally out of habit: `user-select: none` on body text is a defect, on a button it's correct.
2. **Media queries over device sniffing.** `(hover: hover)`, `(pointer: fine)`, `env()`, `dvh`. The platform tells you what it can do. Never branch on user agent strings or screen width to guess at touch.
3. **Touch and mouse are not exclusive.** iPads with trackpads, laptops with touchscreens, phones with a mouse. Write for both at once and gate by capability, not by device.
4. **Never disable zoom.** `user-scalable=no` and `maximum-scale=1` are accessibility failures. Safari ignores them for pinch zoom anyway while other browsers obey and lock low-vision users out. Fix the input font size instead, which is what was causing the zoom.
5. **Test on hardware before calling it done.** Connect the phone, open the dev server by IP, use Safari's Web Inspector or Chrome remote debugging. Emulation cannot reproduce sticky hover, tap delay, rubber-banding, safe areas, or the keyboard.

## The Symptom Table

Start here. Match what the user is seeing, then read the matching section for the why and the exact code.

| Problem | Solution | Section |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hover state stuck after tap | Wrap in `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` | 1 |
| Gray/blue flash on tap | Kill `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` | 2 |
| Layout has the wrong height | `100dvh` (app) or `100svh` (hero) | 3 |
| Page zooms into input | Input font size 16px at the minimum | 4 |
| Tap feels laggy | Feedback on pointer-down + `touch-action: manipulation` | 5 |
| Taps miss small buttons | 44px hit area through a pseudo-element | 6 |
| Pull-to-refresh hijacks scroll | `overscroll-behavior: none` on `html, body` | 7 |
| Content stops at the notch | `viewport-fit=cover` + `env(safe-area-inset-*)` | 8 |
| Keyboard covers the input or the CTA | `interactive-widget=resizes-content` + `dvh` | 9 |
| Keyboard opens by itself | No `autoFocus` on coarse pointers | 9 |
| Long-press selects button text | `user-select: none` on controls only | 10 |
| Carousel scrolls vertically | `touch-action: pan-y` on the gesture surface | 11 |

| Status bar color doesn't match | `theme-color` per color scheme | 13 |
| Anchor links land under the sticky header | `scroll-margin-top` | 14 |
| Right in Chrome, wrong on phone | Test on real hardware | 15 |

## The Fixes

### 1. Hover state stuck after tap

Touch has no hover, so browsers fake one: the first tap on an element applies `:hover` and leaves it there until the user taps somewhere else. A button that scales up on hover stays scaled up after being tapped. Gate every hover style behind a capability query.

```css
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .button:hover {
    background: var(--gray-3);
    transform: scale(1.02);
  }
}
```

Both conditions matter. `(hover: hover)` means the primary input can hover. `(pointer: fine)` means it's precise, like a mouse, which rules out styluses and the odd Android device that claims hover support. In Tailwind v4 the `hover:` variant already compiles to `@media (hover: hover)`; in v3 set `future.hoverOnlyWhenSupported`.

Touch users still need press feedback. Give it to them through `:active` (section 5), which works on every input type. And nothing may be reachable through hover alone: a row action that only appears on hover doesn't exist on a phone. Render it always at lower emphasis, or reveal it on `:focus-within` too.

### 2. Gray/blue flash on tap

iOS Safari and Android Chrome paint a translucent highlight over any tapped element that has a click handler. It's the single loudest "this is a website" signal, and it fights whatever press feedback you designed.

```css
html {
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
}
```

Set it once, globally. Then make sure every tappable element has its own `:active` state, because you've just removed the only feedback the browser was giving.

### 3. Layout has the wrong height

`100vh` on mobile is the *largest* viewport, the height with the browser chrome collapsed. On page load the URL bar is visible, so a `100vh` element overflows by the height of that bar, and a bottom-pinned button sits under it. Use the dynamic and small units instead:

```css
/* App shell, drawers, anything that should track the visible area as chrome shows/hides */
.app { height: 100dvh; }

/* Heroes and first screens: the smallest the viewport gets, so nothing is ever cut off */
.hero { min-height: 100svh; }
```

`dvh` resizes as the URL bar collapses, which is right for an app shell but causes layout shifts on marketing content mid-scroll. `svh` is stable and never overflows, which is right for a hero. `lvh` is the old `vh` and you almost never want it. In Tailwind: `h-dvh`, `min-h-svh`; `h-screen` and `min-h-screen` are `100vh` and carry the bug. Keep a `100vh` fallback line above only if the project's support matrix demands it.

### 4. Page zooms into the input

iOS Safari zooms the page when focus lands on an input whose font size is under 16px, and it does not zoom back out on blur. The user is left looking at a cropped, drifted layout. This is the reason people reach for `maximum-scale=1`, which is the wrong fix (Hard Rule 4).

```css
input, textarea, select {
  font-size: 16px; /* the minimum; 1rem at the default root size */
}
```

If the design calls for smaller text in inputs on desktop, scale it up only where it matters:

```css
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  input, textarea, select { font-size: 16px; }
}
```

In Tailwind: `text-base md:text-sm`. `text-sm` alone on an input is the bug.

While you're in the inputs, set the keyboard: `inputmode="numeric"` for codes, `inputmode="decimal"` for amounts, `type="email"` and `type="tel"` for their fields, `autocapitalize="none"` and `autocorrect="off"` on usernames and codes, `autocomplete="one-time-code"` on verification inputs so iOS offers the SMS code, `enterkeyhint="send"` / `"search"` / `"done"` so the return key says what it does. The rest of form behavior lives in `emil-forms-and-inputs`.

### 5. Tap feels laggy

Two separate causes stack here.

**The 300ms click delay.** Browsers wait after a tap to see whether a second tap is coming, because double-tap zooms. Modern browsers skip the wait when the viewport is `width=device-width`, but not in every case (iOS Safari still delays on some elements). `touch-action: manipulation` tells the browser this element never double-tap-zooms, so it fires `click` immediately:

```css
button, a, input, [role="button"], .tappable {
  touch-action: manipulation;
}
```

**Feedback on release instead of press.** Native buttons respond the instant your finger lands. A web button that only changes on `click` responds when your finger *leaves*, which reads as lag even at 0ms. Style `:active`, and if you need JavaScript for the visual, listen to `pointerdown`, not `click`:

```css
.button {
  transition: transform 100ms var(--ease-out), background 100ms;
}
.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
  background: var(--gray-4);
}
```

The *feedback* fires on press; the *action* still fires on `click`, so the user can cancel by sliding their finger off. Keep press feedback at 100–160ms and `ease-out`, never below `scale(0.95)`. If the codebase already has easing tokens (see `emil-animations`), use them. Don't fork a new curve.

### 6. Taps miss small buttons

A finger pad covers about 44px. A 24px icon button with a 24px hit area gets mis-tapped, and the user blames themselves, then the app. The visual can stay small; the hit area can't.

```css
.icon-button {
  position: relative;
  width: 24px;
  height: 24px;
}
.icon-button::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: -10px; /* 24 + 10 + 10 = 44 */
}
```

In Tailwind: `relative before:absolute before:-inset-2.5`. Two hit areas must never overlap. If an extended area collides with a neighbor, shrink both to the largest non-colliding size, or add spacing. Checkbox and radio rows get one `<label>` wrapping the control and the text, so the gap between them isn't a dead zone.

### 7. Pull-to-refresh hijacks scroll

Scrolling past the top of the page triggers pull-to-refresh on Android Chrome and the whole-page rubber band on iOS. Fine on a document. Wrong in an app with its own scroll containers, a drawer the user drags down, or a canvas.

```css
html, body {
  overscroll-behavior: none;
}
```

Then, on any inner scrollable (a sheet's content, a chat list, a sidebar), stop scroll from chaining to the page when it hits the end:

```css
.sheet-content {
  overflow-y: auto;
  overscroll-behavior: contain;
}
```

`contain` keeps the container's own bounce (which feels native) but stops the page behind it from moving. Use `none` on the root, `contain` on children. Never reach for a `touchmove` + `preventDefault()` listener for this. It blocks scrolling entirely and makes the listener non-passive, which costs frames.

When a modal or sheet is open, the page behind it must not scroll. Use a dialog primitive that locks scroll (Base UI, Radix, vaul) rather than `overflow: hidden` on `body`, which iOS Safari has a long history of ignoring for touch scrolling.

### 8. Content stops at the notch

By default the browser letterboxes your page inside the safe area, leaving the notch, Dynamic Island, and home-indicator zones the body's background color. A native app paints edge to edge and pads its *content* away from those zones. Two steps:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />
```

```css
.app-header {
  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
}
.bottom-bar {
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
}
.sheet {
  padding-bottom: calc(1rem + env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px));
}
.sidebar {
  padding-left: env(safe-area-inset-left); /* landscape puts the notch on the side */
}
```

`viewport-fit=cover` lets the page under the notch; `env(safe-area-inset-*)` gives you the insets to pad back out. Without the meta tag the `env()` values are all `0px`. Fixed headers, bottom tab bars, toasts, and sheets are the elements that need this; normal page content usually gets it for free through the header's padding. Give `env()` a fallback (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px)`) when the value is used in a `calc`. In Next.js the meta tag is the `viewport` export: `viewportFit: "cover"`.

### 9. The keyboard covers the input, or opens by itself

The software keyboard takes roughly half the screen, and the two platforms disagree about what happens to the layout. iOS shrinks the *visual* viewport and scrolls the focused input into view. Android Chrome by default overlays the keyboard on top of the page, so a bottom-pinned composer or a fixed CTA ends up underneath it.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover, interactive-widget=resizes-content" />
```

`interactive-widget=resizes-content` makes the keyboard shrink the layout viewport on Android Chrome, so `100dvh` and bottom-pinned inputs react the way they do on iOS. With that in place a chat composer at the bottom of a `100dvh` flex column stays above the keyboard with no JavaScript.

A fixed bottom CTA also covers the last field of a form. Pad the scroll container by the CTA's height plus the safe area, so the final input can scroll clear of it:

```css
.form-scroll {
  padding-bottom: calc(var(--cta-height) + env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px));
}
```

And never open the keyboard for the user. `autoFocus` on a touch device pops the keyboard the moment the screen appears and shoves the layout up before they've read it. Autofocus the first input in a modal on desktop only:

```jsx
const isCoarse =
  typeof window !== "undefined" && window.matchMedia("(pointer: coarse)").matches;

<input autoFocus={!isCoarse} />
```

### 10. Long-press selects button text

Hold a finger on a web button and iOS selects its label, or pops the copy/share callout on a link. Native controls never do that. Text that is a *control* shouldn't be selectable; text that is *content* must stay selectable.

```css
button, [role="button"], .tab, .chip, .drag-handle {
  user-select: none;
  -webkit-user-select: none;   /* Safari still needs the prefix */
  -webkit-touch-callout: none; /* no long-press callout on links/images used as controls */
}
```

Never put `user-select: none` on `body`. Users copy addresses, error messages, and order numbers; that is content.

### 11. Carousel scrolls vertically

A horizontal swipe on a carousel is ambiguous to the browser. It doesn't know whether you're scrolling the page or the track, so it guesses, and the guess is often the page jittering up while the carousel moves. Tell it which axes the element owns:

```css
.carousel {
  touch-action: pan-y; /* the carousel handles horizontal; the browser keeps vertical */
}
.drag-surface {
  touch-action: none;  /* a custom gesture (a drag-to-dismiss sheet, a slider) owns every axis */
}
.vertical-sheet-handle {
  touch-action: pan-x; /* the sheet handles vertical drags; horizontal stays with the browser */
}
```

The values name what the *browser* may still do. `pan-y` on a horizontal carousel means "browser, you keep vertical panning; I'm handling horizontal". `none` means the element handles everything. Use it only on elements that really do, or the user won't be able to scroll past them.

If the carousel is native scroll rather than a JS gesture, prefer `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory` on the track and `scroll-snap-align: start` on slides. The browser's own physics beat a hand-rolled spring, and `touch-action` becomes unnecessary. Gesture-driven motion that you do hand-roll (drag-to-dismiss, sheets) uses springs so it keeps the finger's velocity; see `emil-animations`.

### 12. Video opens fullscreen or won't autoplay

Without `muted`, iOS refuses to autoplay. Without `playsinline`, it hijacks the screen with the fullscreen player the moment the video starts.

```html
<video autoplay muted playsinline loop>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, don't autoplay; show controls instead (`autoPlay={!prefersReducedMotion} controls={prefersReducedMotion}`). Pause it when it scrolls out of view. A looping video below the fold drains a phone battery for nothing; the IntersectionObserver pattern is in `emil-performance`.

### 13. Status bar color doesn't match

The status bar and the browser chrome take their color from `theme-color`. One value means light mode gets a dark bar or dark mode gets a white one. Give each scheme its own:

```html
<meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff" />
<meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#0a0a0a" />
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />
```

Match the value to the color at the very top of your page: the header background, not the brand color. In Next.js set it through the `viewport` export (`themeColor: [{ media, color }]`). If the app switches theme with a class rather than the OS setting, update the tag from JavaScript on toggle. For an installed PWA, `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` and the manifest's `theme_color`/`background_color` are the same decision. Read the colors from the project's tokens. Never invent them.

### 14. Anchor links land under the sticky header

An in-page link scrolls its target to the very top of the viewport, which is exactly where the sticky header sits. On a phone the header is a bigger share of the screen, so the heading the user asked for is fully hidden.

```css
[id] {
  scroll-margin-top: 64px; /* the sticky header's height */
}
```

Cap the sticky header itself. An 80px header on a 375×667 phone in landscape leaves almost no content.

### 15. Right in Chrome, wrong on phone

Nothing above reproduces in device emulation. Sticky hover, the tap highlight, the URL bar's effect on `vh`, input zoom, the click delay, overscroll, safe areas, the software keyboard: every one is a real-hardware behavior.

- Connect the phone over USB, run the dev server on `0.0.0.0`, open it by the machine's LAN IP.
- iOS: Safari → Develop → the device. Android: `chrome://inspect`.
- Test on a phone that's a few years old, not the newest one on your desk. Test with the keyboard open. Test in landscape once.
- Test as an installed PWA if that's a target; standalone mode changes viewport, safe areas, and status bar behavior.

The Xcode Simulator is a step up from emulation but still misses touch feel. Real hardware is the bar.

## Baseline

When starting a mobile-facing app, this is the floor. Ship it before the first component:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover, interactive-widget=resizes-content" />
<meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff" />
<meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#0a0a0a" />
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />
```

```css
html {
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
  -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%; /* no font inflation in landscape */
  overscroll-behavior: none;      /* drop on a scrolling document where pull-to-refresh is welcome */
}

input, textarea, select {
  font-size: 16px;
}

button, a, input, [role="button"] {
  touch-action: manipulation;
}

button, [role="button"] {
  user-select: none;
  -webkit-user-select: none;
}

@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  /* all :hover rules live here */
}
```

In a Next.js app the meta tags are the `viewport` export in the root layout:

```ts
export const viewport: Viewport = {
  width: "device-width",
  initialScale: 1,
  viewportFit: "cover",
  interactiveWidget: "resizes-content",
  themeColor: [
    { media: "(prefers-color-scheme: light)", color: "#ffffff" },
    { media: "(prefers-color-scheme: dark)", color: "#0a0a0a" },
  ],
};
```

## Never Ship

Self-check before you finish.

| Never | Instead |
| --- | --- |
| `user-scalable=no` or `maximum-scale=1` | 16px inputs, which fix the cause |
| Ungated `:hover` | `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` |
| An action reachable only through hover | Always rendered, or revealed on `:focus-within` too |
| `100vh` / `h-screen` for an app shell or bottom-pinned UI | `100dvh` |
| `100dvh` on a marketing hero | `100svh` (no layout shift on scroll) |
| Press feedback on `click` only | `:active` / `pointerdown` |
| A 24px hit area on a 24px icon | Pseudo-element out to 44px, never overlapping a neighbor |
| `touchmove` + `preventDefault()` to stop overscroll | `overscroll-behavior` |
| `overflow: hidden` on `body` as the scroll lock | A dialog primitive that locks scroll |
| `user-select: none` on `body` | Only on controls |
| `touch-action: none` on something the user needs to scroll past | `pan-x` / `pan-y` |
| `env(safe-area-inset-*)` without `viewport-fit=cover` | Add the meta tag or the value is `0` |
| `autoFocus` with no pointer gate | Desktop only, through `(pointer: coarse)` |
| Autoplay video without `muted playsinline` | Both attributes, and no autoplay under reduced motion |
| One `theme-color` for both schemes | One per `prefers-color-scheme` |
| User-agent sniffing to detect touch | `(hover)` / `(pointer)` media queries |
| Declaring it fixed from device emulation | Real hardware |

## Output

Apply the fixes. Then, in at most a few lines:

- **What was wrong**: the symptom matched from the table, and the one-line why.
- **What changed**: file and declaration, one line each.
- **What needs a phone**: which fixes you could verify from code and which the user must confirm on hardware, with what to look for ("open the drawer on an iPhone and confirm the bottom padding clears the home indicator").

Don't pad this into a report. The code is the deliverable.

## Tone

Opinionated and brief. Most of these are one line; say the line and the reason and move on. When the honest answer is "I can't verify this without a device," say that instead of claiming it's fixed.
